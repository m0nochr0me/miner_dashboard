# Miner Dashboard

This Andriod app displays Slush Pool (Braiins Pool) hashrate, worker status and reward data.
It also displays the balance of the selected BTC wallet, the market price and the "index of fear and greed".

It is recommended to use the application on a permanently fixed smartphone or tablet with an always-on screen.

## Stack

## Notes

I strongly recommend building application by yourself to not letting anyone know your API key.
